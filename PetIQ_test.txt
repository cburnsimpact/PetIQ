HR Chatbot POC Plan — Pet IQ
Phase 1: Foundational Proof of Concept (Pre-Lyric Data)
Goal: Demonstrate the feasibility and complexity of an HR chatbot that can operate within Pet IQ’s unique environment, serving as a technical foundation for future production deployment.
Objectives:
•	Validate chatbot functionality in handling HR-related inquiries.
•	Demonstrate secure identity verification for users communicating via personal email.
•	Show backend workflow logic (intake, triage, and response) without dependency on Lyric HR data.
•	Establish a technical baseline for production readiness.
Tasks
1.	Environment Setup
•	Configure sandbox environment replicating Pet IQ’s communication realities (limited Teams/computer usage).
•	Set up mocked HR data or sample datasets for demonstration.
2.	Chatbot Prototype Development
•	Develop front-end conversational interface (Teams or web-based).
•	Create logic to recognize and respond to HR-related requests.
•	Implement multi-step user verification for personal email addresses.
3.	Backend and Automation
•	Build triage logic for handling inbound HR messages from non-domain emails.
•	Simulate routing and response workflows to HR support queues.
•	Implement audit logging and status tracking for inquiries.
4.	Demonstration and Review
•	Present live demonstration showing:
o	Identity verification process.
o	Handling of personal email communications.
o	Triage and response flow.
o	Educate stakeholders on solution complexity and production requirements.
5.	Documentation
•	Technical setup guide for chatbot and backend components.
•	Flow diagrams showing user identity verification and data handling.
•	Outline of potential production migration path.
 
Phase 2: Integrated Proof of Concept (Post-Lyric Data Availability)
Goal: Enhance the chatbot to connect directly with HR data systems (e.g., Lyric) for real-time employee information and process automation.
Objectives
•	Integrate with live HR data sources for employee validation, record access, and updates.
•	Demonstrate two-way data flow and automation for HR tasks.
•	Transition from mocked logic to production-grade data and security handling.
Tasks
1.	Data Integration
•	Connect chatbot backend to Lyric and other HR systems via secure APIs.
•	Enable lookup and validation of employee information (status, eligibility, benefits).
2.	Process Automation
•	Enable chatbot-driven self-service workflows (e.g., “Request PTO,” “Update Address,” “View Benefits”).
•	Add adaptive responses based on real HR data.
3.	Security and Compliance
•	Enforce identity verification tied to employee records.
•	Implement role-based access controls.
•	Validate data retention and audit policies for HR data.
4.	Performance and Load Testing
•	Assess scalability and concurrency under real usage conditions.
•	Optimize chatbot response time and reliability.
5.	Production Transition Plan
•	Finalize documentation for deployment into Pet IQ’s environment.
•	Define support model, ownership, and training for internal HR/IT teams.
•	Deliver final recommendation for go-live readiness.
